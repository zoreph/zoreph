### Ezra here. Aspiring technical writer (API docs?) learning enough coding to be dangerous.

Diving into the world of API docs after years as an audio engineer, and learning:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- How to use GitHub effectively

## This is what I'm up to:

- Taking online classes
- Scouring the web for open source projects to contribute to
- Kicking my imposter syndrome in the face
